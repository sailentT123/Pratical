# a)
x = 7 + 3 * 6 / 2 - 1
# The order of operations is: multiplication, division, addition, subtraction.
# So, x = 7 + 18 / 2 - 1 = 7 + 9 - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15

# b)
x = 2 % 2 + 2 * 2 - 2 / 2
# The order of operations is: modulus, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction.
# So, x = 0 + 4 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3

# c)
x = ( 3 * 9 * ( 3 + ( 9 * 3 / ( 3 ) ) ) )
# The order of operations is: operations in parentheses, multiplication, division, addition.
# So, x = ( 3 * 9 * ( 3 + ( 27 / 3 ) ) ) = ( 3 * 9 * ( 3 + 9 ) ) = ( 3 * 9 * 12 ) = 324
